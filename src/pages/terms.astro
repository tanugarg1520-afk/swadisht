      <h2>4. Ordering and Payment</h2>
      <p>
        When you place an order through the Platform, you are offering to purchase food items from our Restaurant Partners. The acceptance of your order takes place when the Restaurant Partner accepts your order. Swadisht reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason at any time.

      <p>
        Payment for orders is processed through our secure payment gateway. By providing your payment information, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you have selected.

      <h2>5. Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        Swadisht will make reasonable efforts to ensure that orders are delivered within the estimated delivery time provided at the time of order placement. However, delivery times are estimates and not guarantees. Delivery times may be affected by factors such as weather conditions, traffic, and order volume.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        You may cancel an order only if the Restaurant Partner has not yet accepted the order. Once an order has been accepted, cancellations may be subject to a cancellation fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refunds may be issued in cases where the food delivered does not match the order, is of poor quality, or is damaged during delivery. Refund requests must be made within 24 hours of delivery.
